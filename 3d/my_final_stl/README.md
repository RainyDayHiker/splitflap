This folder contains my "final" STLs for my SplitFlap build.

Starting point was the frame pieces from https://www.printables.com/model/1043629-compact-splitflap-display and the flaps generated by scripts in this repo.

Changes:
- Spool: Modified the interior to have enough curves to not require any supports
- Right Plate: Changed the holder for the nuts in the center of the top rails so that the nuts are trapped.  Added some flaps to provide a cable channel.
- Left Plate: Added some flaps to provide a cable channel.
- Not a Mount: just a spacer to use when I don't need a mount but want something to stiffen everything up

Flaps are generated with Instruction and NotoEmoji fonts.  Two sets - one for most of the characters and one with weather icons for a single character.  Biggest change from original set is that I replaced some colors with emojis.
